# Browser_Control
The interaction between a user and a deviceâ€”a hand gesture recognition method
---
The purpose of this report is to outline an Arduino project that deals with controlling a
web browser using hand gestures. The project will use ultrasonic sensors to detect the motion
of the hand and utilise Arduino and Python to connect the motion to the web browser of a
laptop. It is expected that the project allows hand gestures to carry out certain functions on a
web browser such as scrolling up and down or switching to different tabs open in a window.
